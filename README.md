## <p align=center>About the game</p>

<p align=center>... is a 2D top-down cyberpunk game which you're controlling a **katana master**.
With him, you will take down your enemies by using his favorite weapons :
  * His *katana* which you'll dash through your enemies to kill them for example
  * His *shurikens* which you'll throw at your enemies to hurt them too and much more...</p>

<p align=center>Using your abilities by taking down enemies will allow you to charge up your **fury bar** and when this is at its maximum you'll do so much **more damage** that you couldn't imagine.</p>

<p align=center>But careful ! You have a **stamina bar** which allows you to use your spells ! Use it **wisely** !</p>

In order to beat your enemies, you'll have to find your way through buildings to defeat a much bigger enemy !
